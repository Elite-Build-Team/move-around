# What is a product backlog in Agile?

According to the official Scrum Guide, the product backlog is “...an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.”

The product backlog sits outside of the sprint loop (meaning it contains work that will not be completed during the current sprint) but informs how your sprint will be planned. The product backlog is composed of feedback from:

The development team
Customer
Stakeholders
